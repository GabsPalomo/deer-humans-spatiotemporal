Multiple studies have identified SARS-CoV-2 infections in white-tailed deer, making deer a species of interest in understanding spillover risk between humans and wildlife. This project aims to obtain quantitative data that can be used to develop a risk assessment for deer-human interactions that have the potential to lead to spillover or spillback of SARS-CoV-2. Combining surveillance data with ecological information will provide an empirical basis for a risk assessment that could be used to develop and evaluate intervention tools designed to interrupt transmission pathways. This project will focus on relatively high human-density areas where SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to wildlife is more likely to occur.
